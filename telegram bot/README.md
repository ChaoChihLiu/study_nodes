# Telegram Bot with WebHook

Would like to develop a simple bot to help my church services. The idea is to put worship weekly, published articles and hymn all together. 

## üìã Prerequisites

- Minimum 1 CPUs, 2GB RAM
- AWS Linux2023
- nodejs v18.20 or above
- npm v10.7 or above
- TLS 1.2 or above (with domain name)
- <a href='https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks'>Telegram webhook document</a>


## üèóÔ∏è Introduction

My idea about this chatbot is that using network loadbalancer as entry point receives any message from Telegram through webhook; using Nginx terminates SSL connection, and forward request to my bot written in nodejs.

There are something need to know:
- self-signed certificate works, but TLS/SSL must be 1.2+, and have to register domain name in CN or SAN (in my case, I use AWS NLB dummy domain name)
- Telegram webhook only transfers messages to 4 ports: 80, 88, 443, 8443
- can config firewall (in my case, I use AWS security group) to constrain message-transferring from 149.154.160.0/20 and 91.108.4.0/22, if security is your concern

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instruction 

### Generate Self-Signed cert

```bash
 openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509  -subj "/CN=rpg-XXXXX.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com" -keyout rpg-XXXX.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com.key -out rpg-XXXX.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com.crt
```

### Config Nginx

```bash
vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/telegrambot.conf 
```
the config looks like:

```bash
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name rpg-7f76ccf078caba5f.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com;

    ssl_certificate "/home/ec2-user/rpg-7f76ccf078caba5f.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com.crt";
    ssl_certificate_key "/home/ec2-user/rpg-7f76ccf078caba5f.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com.key";
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:446;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```
```bash
sudo systemctl 
```

### Create a Telegram Bot

a. BotFather, open Telegram app, and search botfather

![Find BotFather](./find_botfather.png)

b. create new bot, follow the instruction below, have to enter bot name and username

![Create Bot](./create_new_bot.jpg)

finally, bot token is generated, it looks like '710XXXX207:AAEc-XXXXXXXXXzVqhLqkXIWmFcc'. Keep this token in a safe place!!

Also, after creating bot, botFather also provide hyperlink to find the bot you setup.

### Register Webhook URL

Setup 3 variables below, replace with correct value. 

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7108XXXX07:AAEc-nCcOXXXXXXXXXXdszVqhLqkXIWmFcc
export WEBHOOK_HOST=https://rpg-XXXXX.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com:443
export WEBHOOK_PATH=webhook

echo $TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN;
echo $WEBHOOK_HOST;
echo $WEBHOOK_PATH;

curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/deleteWebhook";
echo "\n"

curl -F "url=$WEBHOOK_HOST/$WEBHOOK_PATH" -F "certificate=@/home/ec2-user/rpg-XXXXX.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com.crt" "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook";
echo "\n"
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/getWebhookInfo";
```
expected result:
![register webhook result](./result_config_webhook.jpg)

after executing commands above, sometimes we may need to wait minutes, then run nodejs code


### Run bot
```bash
sudo nodejs bot.js
```
